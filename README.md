# Cloud Computing Raft 3D

This project implements a distributed system using the Raft consensus algorithm. The system is developed in Go and aims to provide a reliable and fault-tolerant computing environment.

## Features

- **Distributed Consensus**: Implements the Raft algorithm to achieve consensus among multiple nodes.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Ensures the system can recover from node failures.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale with the addition of new nodes.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kush9405/Cloud-computing-Raft-3d.git
cd Cloud-computing-Raft-3d
```

Build the project:

```sh
go build
```

## Usage

Start the Raft cluster on port 8080:

```sh
./Cloud-computing-Raft-3d
```

### Adding a Printer

You can add a printer using the following `curl` command:

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"company":"Creality","model":"Ender 3"}' http://localhost:8080/api/v1/printers
```

### Listing Printers

You can list all printers using the following `curl` command:

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/printers
```
